### - PaloAlto_FW_HA_Interface (DataSource)

> Based on the OOTB module (version 1.4), however, improved the API call. This was due to newer versions of PA (>=10.2.x) changed the API call for the interface counters. On this module we're having the version in mind & using the 'new' API call if the version is >=10.2.x.
